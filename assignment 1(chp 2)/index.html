    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1 </h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out her window for about an hour now.On her desk,lying between the copies of <i>Nature
        </i>,<i>New Scientist </i>,and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed
        copy of <cite>On The Road </cite>.It had been Molly's fovourite book since college ,and the longer she spent in
        these four walls the morse she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.Although many considered her pioneering
        work,unravelling the secrets of the IIama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"></abbr>DNA,to be an
        achievement,Molly <em>did
        </em>think she had sommething better to do.
