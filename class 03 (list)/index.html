        <dt>1. Central processing unit (CPU)</dt>
        <dd>The CPU is a processing unit that functions as the engine of a computer. It controls all processes of a computer and communicates with other components. This device interprets the digital instructions of a c
            omputer application. You may measure a CPU's speed in gigahertz or GHz. Processors with more GHz often help the computer run faster.</dd>
        <dt>2. Modem</dt>
        <dd>The modem is a hardware device that allows computers or routers to receive and send information over a cable or telephone line. When sending a signal, the device modulates by converting digital data to an analog audio signal. Then it transmits the sound over a telephone line and demodulates audio by converting it to digital sound. Some companies may use the modem to send and receive a fax or act as
             auto-answering machines. With the modem, computers can gain internet connectivity using telephone lines.</dd>
             <dt>3. Bit and bytes</dt>
             <dd>Bit is short for binary digit. It's the smallest and most basic unit of data a computer can store. Computers usually store the bit as zeros or ones. A byte is a group of eight bits. It contains enough information to store a single letter or number. Similarly, a kilobyte (KB) is a collection of 1,000 bytes. The following data measurements are similar to a bit:

                1 megabyte is 1000 kilobytes
                1 gigabyte is 1000 megabytes
                1 terabyte is 1000 gigabytes
                1 petabyte is 1000 terabytes</dd>
                <dt>8. Cache</dt><dt>Cache Memory</dt>
                <dd>Computers usually use a cache to move data between the RAM and CPU. A cache temporarily stores data in an accessible folder separate from a computer's main storage. This reserved storage often collects data to help apps, websites, and programs load faster. After you open a website or an app for the first time, the cache stores the files, images, and other content you access on the computer.

                    For example, if you purchase goods online, it downloads all the images, script files, login information, and the content of your shopping cart. When you clear a browser's cache, the retail site may require your login information to restore the settings. You may pronounce this term as "cash."</dd>
